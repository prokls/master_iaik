\chapter{Problem encoding}
\label{ch:enc}

We already discussed how SAT solvers work and which input they take.
We also sketched how hash algorithm properties got broken using
differential cryptanalysis. In this section we combine those
subjects and describe how we designed an attack setting.

\section{STP approach}
\label{sec:enc-stp}
%
Our first approach started with STP~\cite{stp} initially written by Vijay Ganesh and David L. Dill.
It is currently maintained by Mate Soos.

First we wrote an implementation using the CVC language to model the MD4 hash algorithm.
Reimplementing hash algorithms in CVC language (i.e. generating the corresponding code)
seemed cumbersome and we switched to the Python binding. With little modifications to
a working pure-Python implementation, the prototype was working.

However, STP was not fruitful for us, because we needed good control over the SAT encoding
which we expected to have a major influence on the performance. We use minisat as SAT solver
in the backend, but STP allows to exchange it for CryptoMiniSat which is a more modern and
versatile SAT solver.

\section{Two instances and its difference}
\label{sec:enc-algotocnf}
%
\index{algotocnf}
Our second approach was our own library which generated a CNF for a given hash algorithm
implementation which is fed with a symbolic variable. Only integer operations have been
implemented.

Our tool \emph{algotocnf} implements the following strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take a differential characteristic as input and specify the hash algorithm in use.
  \item Initialize symbolic variables for two instances (bitvectors).
    Every bit is therefore represented as a boolean variable.
    If you apply addition, operator overloading in python will ensure
    that clauses are generated to describe the addition consisting of \boolf{XOR}s and \boolf{MAJ}s.
    Equivalently other operations related to integers are implemented as well.
  \item Constants used in the implementation are automatically converted to unit clauses.
  \item After running the hash algorithm with symbolic variables per instance,
    all constraints related to the hash algorithm are added.
  \item Followingly the differential characteristic is read. Values such as $A_i$
    represent intermediate states of bitvectors. Therefore the corresponding bitvectors
    are looked up and constraints resulting from the differential characteristic are
    added.
  \item Finally the SAT solver is called. The CNF was mostly solved on a cluster
    specified in Appendix~\ref{app:setup}. Afterwards the program is run again to
    create the exactly same problem instance and the solver's solution replaces
    symbolic values with boolean values. The resulting differential characteristic
    is parsed backed and printed out.
\end{enumerate}

We think \emph{algotocnf} mainly differs from other SAT tools because of its
differential implementation. When adding clauses resulting from the differential
characteristic as constraints, the question arises how those bit conditions are
encoded. Essentially, we have only boolean values available, but bit conditions
tell constraints such as \enquote{a difference is given, but the actual value
is unknown}.

It seemed trivial to add a \emph{difference variable} for every pair of boolean
values representing a bit in the two instances. Furthermore the difference
variable $\Delta x$ is connected by a XOR with the variables of the pair $(x', x)$.
\[ \Delta x = x' \oplus x \]
Therefore it should be trivial for a preprocessor to simplify the formula
appropriately or actually we don't expect runtime differences for the larger
amount of variables.

This implementation is central to the runtime discussion of chapter~\ref{ch:results}.

TODO: all clauses use a a = b op c design, hence e.g. XOR clauses are not possible for diff vars

TODO: we expect hash algorithm give a pretty dense CNF description

\section{Approach with a differential description}
\label{sec:enc-diff-desc}
%
Using the approach in the previous section, we were able to find actual MD4 collisions
using a SAT solver. A SHA256 implementation followed which obviously lead to worse
runtime results, because the internal state of SHA-256 is much larger (by a factor
of at least 2). Can we further improve the runtime of the SAT solver?

Because we work with bitvectors and apply high-level operations like \boolf{MAJ} or addition,
we can additionally implement how differences in those operations propagate.
Magnus Daum's thesis on \enquote{Cryptanalysis of Hash Functions of the
MD4-Family}~\cite[Table 4.4]{daum} discusses how differences propagate in \boolf{MAJ} and
\boolf{ITE} functions. Trivially, \boolf{XOR}s propagate differences the way they are.

This approach explicitly models differentiable behavior, which should be deducible
by the SAT solver itself. However, this lead to a major speedup which can be observed
in the runtime results of chapter~\ref{ch:results}.

\section{Influencing evaluation order}
\label{sec:enc-order}
%
\begin{prop}
  Deriving difference values first, followed by actual bit values for the two instances,
  leads to a speedup.
\end{prop}

This proposed principle is fundamental to differential cryptanalysis. A previous tool
at our institute implements propagation of hash algorithm values without SAT solver
and this strategy is essential to good performance. So basically in terms of SAT solvers
we want to guess values for differential variables first and furthermore false should
be assigned first, before guessing for true. This is justified by the desire to find as
little differences as possible in a hash collision.

The development of lingeling ats1o1 was guided by the desire to influence the evaluation
order. We explicitly enforced it with the following approach:

Let $\Delta x$ be the difference variable of pair $(x, x')$. We introduce a new boolean
variable $x^*$. We add clause
\[ x^* = (\Delta x \land x) \]
and explicitly tell the SAT solver to guess on $x^*$ before guessing on $\Delta x$, $x$ or $x'$.

The SAT solver will assign $x'=0$ first, because of the evaluation order. So either $\Delta x$
or $x$ must be false. $\Delta x$ is assigned false, because as difference variable it has a higher
priority over $x$. Equivalently for $x'=1$ we have $\Delta x$ needs to be true. So we actually
achieve an early guess on the difference variable.

This another approach evaluates in the results chapter.
