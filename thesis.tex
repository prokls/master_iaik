\begin{abstract}%
  \parskip5pt
  Hash functions are ubiquitous in the modern information age. They provide preimage, second preimage
  and collision resistance ensuring data and origin integrity. They are used as cryptographic primitives
  in protocols and applications.

  In August 2006, Wang et al. showed efficient attacks against several hash function designs including
  MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128 and RIPEMD. With these results differential cryptanalysis has been proven useful
  to break collision resistance in hash functions. Over the years advanced attacks based on those
  differential approaches have been developed.

  In this thesis we encode differential attack settings as SAT problems.
  SAT solvers are utilized to solve the problem revealing actual message collisions for a defined message difference.

  \textbf{Keywords:} hash function, differential cryptanalysis, MD4, collision resistance, satisfiability, SAT solver

  First of all I would like to thank my academic advisor for his continuous support
  during this project. Many hours of debugging were involved in writing this
  master thesis project, but thanks to Florian Mendel, this project came to a release
  with nice results.

  I would also like to thank Maria Eichlseder for her great support. Her unique
  way to ask questions brought me back on track several times.
  Mate Soos supported me during my bachelor thesis with SAT related issues
  and his support continued with this master thesis in private conversations.

  Also thanks to Roderick Bloem and Armin Biere who organized a meeting
  one year before submitting this work defining the main approaches involved
  in this thesis.

  And finally I am grateful for the support by Martina,
  who also supported me during good and bad days with this thesis,
  and my parents which provided a prosperous environment to me
  to be able to be where I am today.

  Thank you!
