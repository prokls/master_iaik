\chapter{Hash algorithms}
\label{ch:hash}

In this chapter, we will define hash functions and their desired security
properties. In the following, we look at SHA-256 and MD4 as established hash functions.
MD4 unlike SHA-256 is practically broken, but has a comparably small internal state.
It therefore allows a good starting point to devise our attacks.
In a next step, we scaled up to SHA-256 which has an internal state size
at least twice as large.
In Chapter~\ref{ch:enc}, we will represent them with Boolean algebra to allow
to reason about states in those hash functions using SAT solvers.

\section{Preliminaries Redux}
\label{sec:hash-prelim}
%
\index{Hash value}
\index{Preimage}
\index{Hash function}
\begin{defi}[Hash function]
  A \emph{hash function} is a mapping $h: X \to Y$ with $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^*$ and
  $Y = \left\{0,1\right\}^n$ for some fixed $n \in {\symbol{"2115}}_{\geq 1}$.  % FAIL
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Let $x \in X$, then $h(x)$ is called \emph{hash value of $x$}.
    \item Let $h(x) = y \in Y$, then $x$ is called \emph{preimage of $y$}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defi}

Hash functions are considered as cryptographic primitives
used as building blocks in cryptographic protocols.
A hash function has to satisfy the following security requirements:

\index{Preimage resistance}
\begin{defi}[Preimage resistance]
  Given $y \in Y$,
  a hash function $h$ is \emph{preimage resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible
  to find $x \in X$ such that $h(x) = y$.
\end{defi}

\clearpage
\index{Second-preimage resistance}
\begin{defi}[Second-preimage resistance]
  Given $x \in X$,
  a hash function $h$ is \emph{second-preimage resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible
  to find $x_2 \in X$ with $x \neq x_2$ such that $h(x) = h(x_2)$.
  $x_2$ is called \emph{second preimage}.
\end{defi}

\index{Collision resistance}
\index{Collision}
\begin{defi}[Collision resistance]
  A hash function $h$ is \emph{collision resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible to
  find any two $x \in X$ and $x_2 \in X$ with $x \neq x_2$ such that $h(x) = h(x_2)$.
  Tuple $(x, x_2)$ is called \emph{collision}.
\end{defi}

As far as hash functions accept input strings of arbitrary length, but return a fixed
size output string, existence of collisions is unavoidable~\cite{schlaffer}.
However, good hash functions make it very difficult to find collisions or preimages.

Any digital data can be hashed (i.e. used as input to a hash function) by considering
it in binary representation. The format or encoding is not part of the hash function's
specification.

\subsection{Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd designs}
\label{sec:hash-md}
%
The Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd design is a particular design of hash functions providing the
following security guarantee:

\begin{defi}[Collision resistance inheritance]
  Let $F_0$ be a collision resistant compression function.
  A hash function in Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd design is collision resistant if $F_0$ is collision resistant.
\end{defi}

This motivates thorough research of collisions in compression functions.
The design was found independently by Ralph C. Merkle and Ivan B. Damg\aa{}rd.
It was described by Merkle in his PhD thesis~\cite[p. 13--15]{merkle1979secrecy}
and used in popular hash functions such as MD4, MD5 and the SHA2 hash function family.

The single-pipe design works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt
\item Split the input into blocks of uniform block size.
  If necessary, apply padding to the last block to achieve full block size.
\item Compression function $F_0$ is applied iteratively using the output $y_{i-1}$ of
  the previous iteration and the next input block $x_i$, denoted $y_i = F_0(y_{i-1}, x_i)$.
\item An optional postprocessing function is applied.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Padding and length extension attacks}
\label{sec:hash-length-ext-attack}
%
Hash functions of single-piped Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd design inherently suffer
from length extension attacks. MD4 and SHA-256 apply padding to their input
to normalize their input size to a multiple of its block size.
The compression function is applied afterwards. This design is vulnerable
to length extensions.

Consider some collision $(x_0, x_1)$ with $F_0(x_0) = y = F_0(x_1)$ where $x_0$ and
$x_1$ have a size of one block. Let $p$ be a suffix with size of one block.
Then also $(x_0 \,\|\, p, x_1 \,\|\, p)$ (where $\|$ denotes concatenation)
represents a collision in single-piped Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd designs, because
it holds that:
\[ F_0(F_0(x_0), p) = F_0(F_0(x_1), p) \iff F_0(y, p) = F_0(y, p) \]
Hence $(x_0 \,\|\, p, x_1 \,\|\, p)$ is a collision as well.
As far as $F_0$ is applied recursively to every block, $p$ can be of arbitrary size
and $(x_0, x_1)$ can be of arbitrary uniform size.

Because of this vulnerability, cryptanalysts focus on finding a collision
in compression functions. In our tests will only consider input of one block
and padding will be neglected due to this vulnerability.

\subsection{Example usage}
\label{sec:hash-usage}
%
The following list describes application examples:
%
\begin{description}
  \item[Digital signatures.]
    Digital signatures are schemes to guarantee data and origin integrity.
    They are used to verify authenticity of PDF~documents,
    encrypted emails or software distributions. A digital signature
    can be verified, showing that a particular user was involved in the
    signature process. No third party can forge a digital signature.
    Because the document itself might be too large, only its hash value
    is attached to the hash signature.
  \item[Storing passwords.]
    User account data such as passwords are commonly stored in databases.
    Those databases are subject to theft if network breaches take place
    and the passwords are known to the attackers. Hashing and salting
    those passwords with a hash algorithm before storing them in the database
    is a working countermeasure.
  \item[Commitment schemes.]
    Commitment schemes like Zero-Knowledge Proofs use hash algorithms to ensure the
    original message is possessed by a certain party without revealing the document
    itself. Coin-flipping or secure computation also use hash algorithms as
    cryptographic building blocks.
\end{description}

% One example showing the use of hash functions as primitives are JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
% specified in RFC~7519~\cite{rfc7519}. Its application allows web developers to
% represent claims to be transferred between two parties.
%
% Section~8 defines implementation requirements and refers to RFC~7518~\cite{rfc7518},
% which specifies cryptographic algorithms such as \enquote{HMAC SHA-256} to be
% implemented. It is (besides \enquote{none}) the only required signature and MAC algorithm.

\section{MD4}
\label{sec:dc-md4}
%
\index{MD4}
MD4 is a cryptographic hash function originally described in RFC~1186~\cite{rfc1186},
updated in RFC~1320~\cite{rfc1320} and declared obsolete by RFC~6150~\cite{rfc6150}. It was
invented by Ronald Rivest in 1990 with properties given in Table~\ref{tab:md4}.
In 1995~\cite{Dobbertin1998}, successful full-round attacks have been found to break collision resistance.
Three years later, preimage and second-preimage resistance in MD4 got broken as well.
Some of those attacks are described in~\cite{md4-2007} and \cite{cryptoeprint:2005:151}.
We derived a Python~3 implementation based on a Python~2 implementation
and made it available on github~\cite{md4-py3k}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lcl}
      block size           & 512 bits       & namely variable \texttt{block} in RFC~1320~\cite{rfc1320} \\
      digest size          & 128 bits       & as per Section~3.5 in RFC~1320~\cite{rfc1320} \\
      internal state size  & 128 bits       & namely variables $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ \\
      word size            & 32 bits        & as per Section~2 in RFC~1320~\cite{rfc1320} \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{MD4 hash algorithm properties}
    \label{tab:md4}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

MD4 uses three auxiliary Boolean functions:
\begin{defi}
  The Boolean \boolf{IF} function is defined as follows:
  If the first argument is true, the second argument is returned.
  Otherwise the third argument is returned.

  The Boolean \boolf{MAJ} function returns true if the number
  of arguments with Boolean value true is in the majority.
  The Boolean \boolf{XOR} function returns true if the number
  of arguments with Boolean value true is odd.
\end{defi}

Using the logical operators $\land$ (\boolf{AND}), $\lor$ (\boolf{OR})
and $\neg$ (\boolf{NEG}) we can define them as (see Section~\ref{sec:sat-intro}
for a thorough discussion of these operators):
\begin{align}
  \IF(X,Y,Z) &\coloneqq (X \land Y) \lor (\neg X \land Z) \\
  \MAJ(X,Y,Z) &\coloneqq (X \land Y) \lor (X \land Z) \lor (Y \land Z) \\
  \XOR(X,Y,Z) &\coloneqq (X \land \neg Y \land \neg Z) \lor (\neg X \land Y \land \neg Z) \nonumber\\
              &\lor (\neg X \land \neg Y \land Z) \lor (X \land Y \land Z) \nonumber\\
              &\coloneqq (X \oplus Y \oplus Z)
\end{align}

In the following, a brief overview of MD4 is given.

\begin{description}
  \item[Padding and length extension.]
    First of all, padding is applied. A single bit $1$ is appended to the
    input. As long as the input does not reach a length congruent 448 modulo 512,
    bit $0$ is appended.
    Afterwards, length appending takes place.
    Append the first 64 less significant bits of the input length (without the previous modifications)
    represented in binary.
  \item[Initialization.]
    The message is split into 512-bit blocks (i.e. 16 32-bit words).
    State variables $A_{i}$ with $-4 \leq i < 0$ are initialized with these
    hexadecimal values:
    % remark: A_{-4} := A, A_{-1} := B, A_{-2} := C, A_{-3} := D on Wikipedia
    \[
      \begin{array}{cccc}
        A_{-4} = \texttt{01234567} &
        A_{-1} = \texttt{89abcdef} &
        A_{-2} = \texttt{fedcba98} &
        A_{-3} = \texttt{76543210}
      \end{array}
    \]
  \item[Round function and state variable updates.]
    The round function
    is applied in 3 rounds with 16 iterations.
    In every iteration, values $A_{-1}$, $A_{-2}$ and $A_{-3}$ are taken
    as arguments to function $F$. Function $F$ is \boolf{IF} in round~1,
    followed by \boolf{MAJ} for round~2 and \boolf{XOR} for the final round~3.
    The resulting value is added to $A_{-1}$, current message block $M$
    and constant $X$. Finally, the 32-bit sum will be left-rotated by $p$
    positions. Left rotation is formally defined in Definition~\ref{def:shifts}.
    We define $X$ and $p$:

    Let $i$ be the iteration counter between $1$ and $16$ and
    $r$ the round between $1$ and $3$. Then $X$ takes the value
    of the $i$-th column and $r$-th row of matrix $C$.
    $p$ takes the value of row $r$ and column $i \bmod{4}$ of matrix $P$.
    \[
      C = \left(\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}
        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\
        0 & 4 & 8 & 12 & 1 & 5 & 9 & 13 & 2 & 6 & 10 & 14 & 3 & 7 & 11 & 15 \\
        0 & 8 & 4 & 12 & 2 & 10 & 6 & 14 & 1 & 9 & 5 & 13 & 3 & 11 & 7 & 15
      \end{array}\right)
    \] \[
      P = \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 7 & 9 & 11 \\
        3 & 5 & 9 & 13 \\
        3 & 9 & 11 & 15
      \end{pmatrix}
    \]
    This round function design is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:md4-round-function}.

\section{SHA-256}
\label{sec:dc-sha-256}
%
\index{SHA-256}
SHA-256 is a hash function from the SHA-2 family designed by the National Security Agency (NSA)
and published as FIPS PUB 180-4 (originally 2001)~\cite{fips-pub-180-4}.
It uses a Merkle-Damg\aa{}rd construction with a Davies-Meyer compression function.
The best known preimage attack was found in 2011
and breaks preimage resistance for 52~rounds~\cite{bicliques}. The best known collision attack
breaks collision resistance for 31~rounds of SHA-256~\cite{improving} and pseudo-collision
resistance for 46~rounds~\cite{high2011}. The best practical attack is a pseudo-collision
for 38 steps~\cite{mendel2013improving}.

\index{Left-shift}
\index{Right-shift}
\index{Left-rotation}
\index{Right-rotation}
\begin{defi}[Shifts, rotations and a notational remark]
  \label{def:shifts}
  Consider a 32-bit word $X$ with 32 binary values $b_i$ with $0 \leq i \leq 31$.
  $b_0$ refers to the least significant bit. Shifting ($≪$ and $≫$) and
  rotation ($⋘$ and $⋙$) creates a new 32-bit word $Y$ with 32 binary values $a_i$.
  We define the following notations:
  \begin{align*}
    Y \coloneqq X ≪ n  &\iff a_i \coloneqq b_{i-n} \text{ if } 0 \leq i-n < 32 \text{ and } 0 \text{ otherwise } \\
    Y \coloneqq X ≫ n  &\iff a_i \coloneqq b_{i+n} \text{ if } 0 \leq i+n < 32 \text{ and } 0 \text{ otherwise } \\
    Y \coloneqq X ⋘ n  &\iff a_i \coloneqq b_{i-n \bmod{32}} \text{ as used in MD4} \\
    Y \coloneqq X ⋙ n  &\iff a_i \coloneqq b_{i+n \bmod{32}}
  \end{align*}
\end{defi}
%
Besides MD4's \boolf{MAJ} and \boolf{IF},
another four auxiliary functions are defined. Recognize that $\oplus$ denotes
the \boolf{XOR} function whereas $\boxplus$ denotes 32-bit addition.
\[
  \begin{array}{rcccccl}
    \Sigma_0(X) &\coloneqq& (X ⋙ 2) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 13) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 22) \\
    \Sigma_1(X) &\coloneqq& (X ⋙ 6) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 11) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 25) \\
    \sigma_0(X) &\coloneqq& (X ⋙ 7) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 18) &\oplus& (X ≫ 3) \\
    \sigma_1(X) &\coloneqq& (X ⋙ 17) &\oplus& (X ⋙ 19) &\oplus& (X ≫ 10)
  \end{array}
\]
%
\begin{description}
  \item[Padding and length extension.]
    The padding and length extension scheme of MD4 is used also in SHA-256.
    Append bit $1$, followed by a sequence of bit $0$ until the message reaches a length
    of 448 modulo 512 bits. Afterwards the first 64 bits of the binary representation
    of the original input are appended.
  \item[Initialization.]
    In a similar manner to MD4, initialization of internal state variables
    (called \enquote{working variables} in~\cite[Section~6.2.2]{fips-pub-180-4})
    takes place before running the round function. The eight state variables
    are initialized with the following hexadecimal values:
    \[
      \begin{array}{llll}
        A_{-1} = \texttt{6a09e667} &
        A_{-2} = \texttt{bb67ae85} &
        A_{-3} = \texttt{3c6ef372} &
        A_{-4} = \texttt{a54ff53a} \\
        E_{-1} = \texttt{510e527f} &
        E_{-2} = \texttt{9b05688c} &
        E_{-3} = \texttt{1f83d9ab} &
        E_{-4} = \texttt{5be0cd19}
      \end{array}
    \]
    Furthermore SHA-256 uses 64 constant values in its round function.
    We initialize step constants $K_i$ for $0 \leq i < 64$ with the following hexadecimal
    values (which must be read left to right and top to bottom):
    \[
      \begin{array}{cccccc}
        \texttt{428a2f98} & \texttt{71374491} & \texttt{b5c0fbcf} & \texttt{e9b5dba5} & \texttt{3956c25b} & \texttt{59f111f1} \\
        \texttt{923f82a4} & \texttt{ab1c5ed5} & \texttt{d807aa98} & \texttt{12835b01} & \texttt{243185be} & \texttt{550c7dc3} \\
        \texttt{72be5d74} & \texttt{80deb1fe} & \texttt{9bdc06a7} & \texttt{c19bf174} & \texttt{e49b69c1} & \texttt{efbe4786} \\
        \texttt{0fc19dc6} & \texttt{240ca1cc} & \texttt{2de92c6f} & \texttt{4a7484aa} & \texttt{5cb0a9dc} & \texttt{76f988da} \\
        \texttt{983e5152} & \texttt{a831c66d} & \texttt{b00327c8} & \texttt{bf597fc7} & \texttt{c6e00bf3} & \texttt{d5a79147} \\
        \texttt{06ca6351} & \texttt{14292967} & \texttt{27b70a85} & \texttt{2e1b2138} & \texttt{4d2c6dfc} & \texttt{53380d13} \\
        \texttt{650a7354} & \texttt{766a0abb} & \texttt{81c2c92e} & \texttt{92722c85} & \texttt{a2bfe8a1} & \texttt{a81a664b} \\
        \texttt{c24b8b70} & \texttt{c76c51a3} & \texttt{d192e819} & \texttt{d6990624} & \texttt{f40e3585} & \texttt{106aa070} \\
        \texttt{19a4c116} & \texttt{1e376c08} & \texttt{2748774c} & \texttt{34b0bcb5} & \texttt{391c0cb3} & \texttt{4ed8aa4a} \\

        \texttt{90befffa} & \texttt{a4506ceb} & \texttt{bef9a3f7} & \texttt{c67178f2}
      \end{array}
    \]
  \item[Precomputation of W.]
    Let $W_i$ for $0 \leq i < 16$ be the sixteen 32-bit words of the padded input message.
    Then compute $W_i$ for $16 \leq i < 64$ the following way:
    \[ W_i \coloneqq \sigT(W_{i-2}) + W_{i-7} + \sigO(W_{i-15}) + W_{i-16} \]
  \item[Round function.]
    For every block of 512~bits, the round function is applied.
    The eight state variables are updated iteratively for $i$ from 0 to 63.
    $W_i$ and $K_i$ refer to the previously initialized values.
    \begin{align*}
      E_i     &\coloneqq A_{i-4} + E_{i-4} + \SigT(E_{i-1}) + \IF{(E_{i-1}, E_{i-2}, E_{i-3})} + K_i + W_i \\
      A_i     &\coloneqq E_i - A_{i-4} + \SigO(A_{i-1}) + \MAJ{(A_{i-1}, A_{i-2}, A_{i-3})}
    \end{align*}
%   \item[Computation of intermediate hash values.]
%     Intermediate hash values for the Davies-Meyer construction are
%     initialized with the following values:
%     \[
%       \begin{array}{cp{10pt}cp{10pt}cp{10pt}c}
%         H_0^{(0)} \coloneqq A_{-1}  & &  H_1^{(0)} \coloneqq A_{-2}  & &  H_2^{(0)} \coloneqq A_{-3}  & &  H_3^{(0)} \coloneqq A_{-4} \\
%         H_4^{(i)} \coloneqq E_{-1}  & &  H_5^{(i)} \coloneqq E_{-2}  & &  H_6^{(i)} \coloneqq E_{-3}  & &  H_7^{(i)} \coloneqq E_{-4} \\
%       \end{array}
%     \]
%     Every block creates its own $E_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ values for $60 \leq i < 64$.
%     These are used to compute the next intermediate values:
%     \[
%       \begin{array}{lp{10pt}r}
%         H_0^{(j)} \coloneqq A_{63} + H_0^{(i-1)}  & &  H_4^{(j)} \coloneqq E_{63} + H_4^{(i-1)} \\
%         H_1^{(j)} \coloneqq A_{62} + H_1^{(i-1)}  & &  H_5^{(j)} \coloneqq E_{62} + H_5^{(i-1)} \\
%         H_2^{(j)} \coloneqq A_{61} + H_2^{(i-1)}  & &  H_6^{(j)} \coloneqq E_{61} + H_6^{(i-1)} \\
%         H_3^{(j)} \coloneqq A_{60} + H_3^{(i-1)}  & &  H_7^{(j)} \coloneqq E_{60} + H_7^{(i-1)}
%       \end{array}
%     \]
%   \item[Finalization.]
%     The final hash digest of size 256 bits is provided as
%     \[
%       H_0^{(N)} \concat
%       H_1^{(N)} \concat
%       H_2^{(N)} \concat
%       H_3^{(N)} \concat
%       H_4^{(N)} \concat
%       H_5^{(N)} \concat
%       H_6^{(N)} \concat
%       H_7^{(N)}
%     \]
%     where $N$ denotes the index of the last block and operator $\|$ denotes
%     concatenation. Hence $H_0^{(N)}$ are the four least significant bytes of the digest.
