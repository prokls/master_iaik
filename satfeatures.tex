\chapter{SAT features}
\label{ch:features}
%
At the very beginning I was very intrigued by the question
\enquote{What is an \enquote{average} SAT problem?}. Answers to this
question can help to optimize SAT solver memory layouts.
Specifically for this thesis I wanted to find out whether
our problems distinguish from \enquote{average} problems in any
way such that we can use this distinction for runtime optimization.

I came up with 8 questions related to basic properties of SAT problems
we will discuss in depth in this section:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given an arbitrary literal. What is the percentage it is positive?
\item What is the variables / clauses ratio?
\item How many literals occur only either positive or negative?
\item What is the average and longest clause length among CNF benchmarks?
\item How many Horn clauses exist in a CNF?
\item Are there any tautological clauses?
\item Are there any CNF files with more than one connected variable component?
\item How many variables of a CNF are covered by unit clauses?
\end{enumerate}

We will now define the terms used in those questions.

\section{SAT features and CNF analysis}
\label{sec:features-analysis}
%
\index{SAT feature}
\index{Feature value}
\begin{defi}[SAT feature]
  A \emph{SAT feature} is a statistical value (named \emph{feature value})
  retrievable from some given SAT problem.
\end{defi}

The most basic example of a SAT feature is the number of variables and clauses
of a given SAT problem. This SAT feature is stored in the CNF header of a SAT
problem encoded in the DIMACS format.

The general goal is to write a tool which evaluates several SAT features at the same
time and retrieve them for comparison with other problems. Therefore it should be
computationally easy to evaluate SAT features of a given SAT problem. A suggested
computational limit is given with polynomial complexity in terms of number of
variables and number of clauses for memory as well as runtime for evaluation algorithms.
Sticking to this convention implies that evaluation of satisfiability must not be
necessary to evaluate a SAT feature under the assumption that \cPneqNP. Hence the
number of valid models cannot be a SAT feature as far as satisfiability needs to
be determined. But no actual hard computational limit is defined.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:features-related}
%
The most similar resource I found looking at SAT features was the
SATzilla project~\cite{satzilla2004,satzilla2008} in 2012. The authors systematically defined
138 SAT~features categorized in 12 groups. The features themselves are not
defined formally, but an implementation is provided bundled with example data.
The following list provides an excerpt of the features:

\begin{description}
\item[\satfeature{nvarsOrig}] number of variables defined in the CNF header
\item[\satfeature{nvars}] number of active variables
\item[\satfeature{reducedVars}] \satfeature{nvarsOrig} - \satfeature{nvars}, divided by \satfeature{nvars}
\item[\satfeature{vars-clauses-ratio}] nvars divided by number of active clauses
\item[\satfeature{POSNEG-RATIO-CLAUSE-mean}] mean of $2 \cdot \left\| 0.5 - {\text{pos}_c}/{\text{length}_c}\right\|$ where $\text{pos}_c$ is the number of positive literals of clause $c$ and $\text{length}_c$ clause length of $c$
\item[\satfeature{POSNEG-RATIO-CLAUSE-entropy}] like \satfeature{POSNEG-RATIO-CLAUSE-mean} but entropy
\item[\satfeature{TRINARY+}] number of clauses with clause length 1, 2 or 3 divided by number of active clauses
\item[\satfeature{HORNY-VAR-min}] minimum number of times a variable occurs in a horn clause
\item[\satfeature{cluster-coeff-mean}]
   let neighbors of a clause be all clauses containing any literal negated
   and let clauses $c_1$ and $c_2$ be conflicting if $c_1$ contains literal $l$ and $c_2$ contains $-l$,
   then return the mean of $2$ times the number of conflicting neighbors of a clause $c$
   divided by the number of unordered pairs of neighbors,
   returned iff computable within 20 seconds for all clauses
\end{description}

Please recognize that active clauses are the unsatisfied clauses after BCP has been applied.
Equivalently active variables are remaining variables after application of BCP.

Many SAT solvers collect feature values to improve algorithm selection,
restart strategies and estimate problem sizes. Recent trends to apply Machine
Learning to SAT solving imply feature evaluation. SAT features and the resulting
satisfiability runtime are used as training data for Machine Learning. One example
using SAT features for algorithm selection is ASlib~\cite{aslib}.

Previous work has shown that expensive algorithms can provide useful data in a
small time frame if they are limited to a constant subproblem size.

\section{Statistical features}
\label{sec:features-stats}
%
For our SAT~features we need to define some basic statistical terminology.
Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be a finite sequence of numbers ($n \in \mathbb N$).
\begin{description}
  \item[Arithmetic mean] (or short: mean)
    is defined as
    \[ \overline{x} = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \]
  \item[Standard deviation] (or short: sd)
    with mean $\overline{x}$ is defined as
    \[ \sigma(x) = \sqrt{\frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})} \]
  \item[Median]
    with $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \ldots \leq x_n$
    (i.e. sorted ascendingly) is defined as
    \[
       m = \begin{cases}
         x_{\lceil \text{mid}\rceil} & \text{if } n \text{ odd} \\
         \frac{x_{\text{mid}} + x_{\text{mid} + 1}}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ even}
       \end{cases}
       \quad\text{ with } \text{mid} = \frac{n}{2}
    \]
    and often considered more \enquote{robust} than the arithmetic mean.
  \item[Entropy]
    is defined according to Claude Shannon's information theory:
    \[ H(x) = -\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot \log_2(x_i) \]
    where $0 \cdot \log_2(0) \coloneqq 0$.
\end{description}

Furthermore \emph{count} refers to the number of elements $n$,
\emph{largest} refers to the maximum element $\max_{1 \leq i \leq n}(x_i)$
and \emph{smallest} refers to the minimum element $\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}(x_i)$.

\section{Suggested SAT features}
\label{sec:features-suggested}

We wrote a tool called cnf-analysis. The evaluated features are partially inspired
by SATzilla and lingeling. The latter prints basic statistics for every CNF it
evaluates.
