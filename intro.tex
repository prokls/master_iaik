\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
%
Hash functions are used as cryptographic primitives in many applications and protocols.
They take an arbitrary input message and provide a hash value. Input message and hash value
are considered as byte strings in a particular encoding.
The hash value is of fixed length and satisfies several properties which make it useful
in a variety of applications.

In this thesis we will consider the hash algorithms MD4 and SHA-256 and represent
differential characteristics of hash collisions as SAT problem. If and only if
satisfiability is given, the particular differential state is achievable
using two different inputs leading to the same output. As far as SAT solvers
return an actual model satisfying that state, we get a complete hash collision
which can be verified and visualized.
If the internal state of the hash algorithm is too large, the attack can be easily
computationally simplified by modelling only a subset of steps of the hash algorithm
or changing the modelled differential path.

Gaining experience with these kind of problems with previous non-SAT-based tools
we try to apply best practices to a satisfiability setting.
We will discuss which SAT techniques lead to best performance characteristics
for our MD4 and SHA-256 testcases.

\index{Hash value}
\index{Preimage}
\index{Hash function}
\begin{defi}[Hash function]
  A \emph{hash function} is a mapping $h: X \to Y$ with $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^*$ and
  $Y = \left\{0,1\right\}^n$ for some fixed $n \in {\mathbb{N}}_{\geq 1}$.
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item Let $x \in X$, then $h(x)$ is called \emph{hash value of $x$}.
    \item Let $h(x) = y \in Y$, then $x$ is called \emph{preimage of $y$}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defi}

One example showing the use of hash functions as primitives are JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
specified in RFC~7519~\cite{rfc7519}. Section~8 defines implementation requirements
and refers to RFC~7518~\cite{rfc7518}, which specifies cryptographic algorithms to
be implemented. \enquote{HMAC SHA-256} (besides \enquote{none}) is the only signature
and MAC algorithm required to be implemented.
SHA-256 as hash algorithm is used as cryptographic primitive in this configuration.

A hash function has to satisfy the following security requirements:

\index{Preimage resistance}
\begin{defi}[Preimage resistance]
  Given $y \in Y$,
  a hash function $h$ is \emph{preimage resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible
  to find $x \in X$ such that $h(x) = y$.
\end{defi}

\index{Second-preimage resistance}
\begin{defi}[Second-preimage resistance]
  Given $x \in X$,
  a hash function $h$ is \emph{second-preimage resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible
  to find $x_2 \in X$ with $x \neq x_2$ such that $h(x) = h(x_2)$.
  $x_2$ is called \emph{second preimage}.
\end{defi}

\index{Collision resistance}
\begin{defi}[Collision resistance]
  A hash function $h$ is \emph{collision resistant} iff it is computationally infeasible to
  find any two $x \in X$ and $x_2 \in X$ with $x \neq x_2$ such that $h(x) = h(x_2)$.
\end{defi}

As far as hash functions accept input strings of arbitrary length, but return a fixed
size output string, existence of collisions is unavoidable~\cite{schlaffer}.
However, good hash functions make it very difficult to determine collisions or preimages.

The considered hash functions apply padding to their input to normalize their
input size to a multiple of its block size. The round function follows afterwards.
In the following we always consider input of block size meaning the round function
is run only for one block and padding is always considered part of this input message.
Padding is negligible, because once we have two colliding blocks,
the collision will be reflected in the output in these single-pipe Merkle-Darmg\aa rd designs.
This results in a length extension attack, making input padding negligible for cryptanalysis.

\section{Cryptanalysis of Hash Functions}
\label{sec:intro-cryptanalysis}
%
In August 2004, Wang et al. published results at Crypto'04~\cite{wang2004} which revealed
that MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128 and RIPEMD can be broken practically using differential cryptanalysis.
Their work is based on preliminary work by Hans Dobbertin~\cite{Dobbertin1998}.
On an IBM~P690 machine, an MD5 collision can be computed in about one hour using this approach.
Collisions for HAVAL-128, MD4 and RIPEMD were found as well. Patrick Stach's \texttt{md4coll.c}
program~\cite{md4coll} implements Wang's approach and can find MD4 collisions in few seconds
on my Thinkpad~x220 setup specified in \hyperref[app:setup]{Appendix~\ref{app:setup}}.

Let $n$ denote the digest size, i.e. the size of the hash value $h(x)$ as number of bits.
Due to the birthday paradox, a collision attack has a generic complexity of $2^{n/2}$
whereas preimage and second preimage attacks have generic complexities of $2^n$.
So it is cryptanalytically easier to find any two colliding hash values than the
preimage or second preimage for a given hash value.

Following results by Wang et al., differential cryptanalysis was shown as
powerful tool for cryptanalysis of hash algorithms. This thesis applies those
ideas to satisfiability approaches.

\section{Differential cryptanalysis}
\label{sec:intro-diff-cryptanalysis}
%
\index{Hash collision}
\begin{defi}[Hash collision]
  Given a hash function $h$,
  a hash collision is a pair $(x, x_2)$ with $x \neq x_2$ such that
  $h(x) = h(x_2)$.
\end{defi}

Differential cryptanalysis is based on the idea to consider two execution states
of hash algorithms for slightly different input messages. We trace those difference
to learn about the propagation of message differences.

MD4 has a block size of 512~bits. Take some message in a particular encoding
and provide this padded byte string as 512~bit input to the hash algorithm.
Then use a copy of this byte string as input to a second hash algorithm implementation
with slight modifications in few bits. MD4 has 48 round function applications
in 3 rounds. Differential cryptanalysis considers the difference in the evaluation
state between the two instances.

Visualizing those differences helps the cryptanalyst to find modifications yielding
a small number of differences in the evaluation state.
The cryptanalyst consecutively modifies the input values to eventually
receive a collision in the output value.
If the number of differences in the evaluation state is small,
this trail is expected to result in a hash collision with higher probability.

      Typical attack setting for a collision attack:
      Hash function $f$ is applied to two inputs $M$ and $M^*$ which differ
      by some predefined bits. A hash collision is given if and only if output values
      $C$ and $C^*$ show the same value. In differential cryptanalysis we observe
      the differences between two instances applying function $f$
      to inputs $M$ and $M^*$.

\section{Satisfiability}

\index{Boolean function}
\begin{defi}
  A \emph{Boolean function} is a mapping $h: X \to Y$ with $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^n$
  for $n \in \mathbb N_{\geq 1}$ and $Y = \left\{0,1\right\}$.
\end{defi}

The following definition gives three basic Boolean functions:

\index{AND}
\begin{defi}
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item
      \emph{AND} maps $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^2$
      to $1$ if all values of $X$ are $1$.
    \item
      \emph{OR} maps $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^2$
      to $1$ if any value of $X$ is $1$.
    \item
      \emph{NOT} maps $X = \left\{0,1\right\}^1$
      to $1$ if the single value of $X$ is $0$.
  \end{itemize}
  All functions return $0$ in the other case.
\end{defi}

\index{Truth table}
\begin{defi}
  A \emph{truth table} unambiguously defines a Boolean function
  by enlisting the evaluated truth value for all possible sets of
  inputs.

  Table~\ref{tab:andornot-truthtables} shows truth tables for
  \boolf{AND}, \boolf{OR} and \boolf{NOT}.
\end{defi}

In the following we discuss how Boolean functions are related
to computation in general and hash algorithms specifically.

\index{Algorithm}
\begin{defi}
  An \emph{algorithm} is a step-wise set of instructions to solve a problem.
\end{defi}

One specific set of algorithms transform a given input to some output according
to some rules. Such algorithms are said to satisfy the \emph{I/O property}.
Hash algorithms satisfy the I/O property.

\begin{theorem}
  Every algorithm can be represented as Boolean function.
\end{theorem}

This is trivial to see considering that computers are built from logic gates.
However, in practice physical properties are used to employ storage of values,
which does not exist in the model of Boolean algebra. This can be mapped to
our Boolean model by constants for stored values and assuming an infinite memory.

\index{Satisfiability}
\index{Assignment}
\index{Model}
\begin{defi}
  A Boolean function $f$ is \emph{satisfiable} iff there exists at least one
  input $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = 1$.
  Every input $x \in X$ satisfying this property is called \emph{model}.
  Every element of $X$ is called \emph{assignment}.
\end{defi}

Consider a certain state during the computation of a hash value.
Represent the computation (i.e. hash algorithm) as Boolean equation system.
Represent the state as assignment to a subset of variables used in the computation.
Now replace, omit or invert some of these variables.
This modified state can be reached with some input if and only if
the SAT problem is satisfiable.

The generic complexity of SAT determination is given by $2^n$ for $n$ Boolean variables.
%This is closely related to the \cP $\overset{?}{\neq}$ \cNP question.
The corresponding tool to determine satisfiability is defined in the following.

\index{SAT solver}
\begin{defi}
  A \emph{SAT solver} is a tool to determine satisfiability of a Boolean function.
  If satisfiability is given, it returns some model.
\end{defi}
